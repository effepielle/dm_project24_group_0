### Abstract
Data Mining project carried out on two datasets comprises of a set of professional cycling races, spanning several years in time. The project consists of data analysis based on data mining tools divided into four tasks:
<br /><br />
Task 1: <b>Data Understanding and Preparation</b>
> Task 1.1: <b>Data Understanding</b>, explore the dataset with the analytical tools. Evaluate data quality, distribution of variables and pairwise correlations
> 
> Task 1.2: <b>Data Preparation</b>, improve the quality of the data and prepare them by extracting new interesting features to describe ...

Task 2: <b>Clustering analysis</b>, 
<br /><br />
Task 3: <b>Predictive Analysis</b>, 
<br /><br />
Task 4:
